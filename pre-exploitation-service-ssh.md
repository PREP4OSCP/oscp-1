# SSH
## Basic Commands
1. connect to the host  
```
nc -nv  10.11.1.71 22

(UNKNOWN) [10.11.1.71] 22 (ssh) open
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2
```
2. try to ssh the server
``` ssh root@10.11.1.71 ```
> capture the output for later use

## Nmap
 We can use nmap to help us out. First, let's check what scripts we have (based on our nmap version):  
```
ls -lh /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ssh*

```
>  So by using "-sV" and "--script=ssh-hostkey", we can automate the banner grabbing as well as key fingerprints.
