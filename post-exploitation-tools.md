### Port Forwarding and Redirection
Scenario: Client (RDP) --> Remote server. won't be able to connect due to egress restrictions in the network.
Solution: Use a proxy machine (Linux), and `rinetd` service to allow port forwarding.
- Proxy
  - `rinetd service` (port forwarding utility)
    - Proxy: 208.88.127.99 (public ip)
    - Client: not importand
    - Server: 67.23.72.109 (destination server with RDP enabled)
- edit `/etc/rinetd.conf`
```
# bindadress    bindport  connectaddress  connectport
208.88.127.99   80        67.23.72.109    3389
```
- restart the service: `/etc/init.d/rinetd restart`
- now within the client machine, open the RDP client and use the proxy machine's ip with port 80
  - `208.88.127.99:80`
